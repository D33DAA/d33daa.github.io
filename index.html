Being close to Maw territory, the desert world is currently not under faction control. Just today, Arcadian Space Marines have landed on the world of Argus, another neutral world, in the system of Orsipyl (0506). A representative of the Arcadian Federation provided this statement:</p>
                            <p>"The recent expansion of the Arcadian Federation is an attempt to prevent any undesirable organisation to upset the otherwise peaceful nature of our galaxy. The moves will protect others and ourselves without encroaching on any rightfully claimed territories."</p>

                            <p>ArcNet probes and passing grey-law ships are reporting that a recent discovery of large cobalt deposits in the asteroid belt  of the Romny system (0604) have lead to a major increase in the amount of mining operations in the area. The system, home to infamous pirate organization The Maw, has a major illegal spaceport, through which most of these mining operations have been setup. Increased numbers of unlicensed miners have been reported in the nearby area, and new industries are being hastily organised. This new rush may be a break in the recent shortages of Cobalt in the sector, however, ArcNet feels responsible to warn against trade with The Maw, due to their illicit activities.</p>

                            <p>New constructions point to Delta Corporation aiming to expand its production, by procuring more raw materials. The biggest arms manufacturer and specialist military contractor in the sector, have constructed a mining facility on its base planet of Ledro (Maz 0104), and on the outskirts of the largest city in Mahni, (Raghnil, 0306), the capital world of the Arcadian Federation. A spokesperson for Delta Corporation had this to say: "Our current expansion will reduce the current inefficiencies surrounding sourcing and producing the rare and expensive resources we need to make our products the best possible value for our customers." Economic reports also show that Delta Corporation is making significant investments into the local economy of Teus (Actolym 0403), the capital world of the Unified Arcadian Collective.</p>

While the space yards of Anas, the biggest industrial and military spaceyard in Federation controlled space are usually home to the system's standing navy, the public are noticing a large amount of combat vessels leaving the yard, and an increased amount of troop carriers in the area. Aside from patrols hunting the usual pirate threats in the sector, the Arcadian Federation is not known to be in any open conflicts at the time of writing, leaving much to speculation. Standard military routine? Training exercises? Or are the Federation preparing to make the first strike in a new intersector conflict? More details as they are received.</p>
