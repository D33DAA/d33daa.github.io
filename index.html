            <h1>Night Vale Station (27/06/16)</h1>
            <p>My latest project is a space station in the End. I think it's quite an interesting idea for a village. Naturally, it has high requirements to entry, as you must make your own way to the end before you are allowed to teleport in and out of it. Additionally, I am adding a rule that space helmets (blocks of glass renamed) must be worn with /hat, with is only available to some player ranks. Additionally, you cannot claim land in the End, so I must be able to trust everyone of my residents.</p>
			<p>This is mostly inspired by my recent playtime in Elite Dangerous and while I find MC lacking for spacey stuff, I am going to do it anyway. It's also inspired by the Welcome to night Vale Podcast that I've been listening to recently. I hope to incorporate the bizarre humour throught the station while keeping it as advanced and useful as possible. Here's a plan I made in MS Paint for the start of the station:</p>
			<img src ="http://i.imgur.com/BsBxq7L.png">
			<p>I'm hoping to include a metro system and a food distribution system. The metro will run under the station by minecart and have junctions, using a system I've designed before. I will also have a fully automatic potato farm that will then be distributed to different parts of the station by minecart running over the station. I'll be using this design: </p>

			<p>The products of this farm will be distributed by the system. The iron farm is top priority for me as the materials I will be using, quartz, and black clay are not cheap. I will also have to make sure the iron farm and food farm are more than 64 blocks apart to prevent issues. I am yet to know if villager ai works in the End, but I will be doing tests.</p>
			<p>In order to restrict access to locations without claims, I have found a helpful tutorial on a passcard system that looks very interesting: </p>

			<p>Just a side note, this is the design I have for the station banner. It's based off the Night Vale logo. Hope you like it!</p>

			<p>I'll update further as time goes on.</p>
