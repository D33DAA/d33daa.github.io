            <p>Originally I set this page up as a blog, but I've repurposed it to handle any art commissions I may provide. I play a lot of games, and as much D&amp;D as I can. In the 9 to 5, I'm a software engineer, and doing a degree in Computer Science.</p>
            <p>Other than that, you can follow me on various social medias or check out my Twitch Streams (I am not regular or consistent and I'm sorry.)</p>
            <p>I develop this site myself, apart from the Bootstrap framework and Disqus comments, and if you're interested you can find the files and commits at my Github Repository in the link below.</p>

                    <p> To be more specific, I will draw your character in a similar style to the <a href="http://na.finalfantasyxiv.com/lodestone/special/fankit/twitter_kit/"> FFXIV Fan Kit </a>Sprites provided by Square Enix </p>
                    <p> If you can't be bothered to click the link, here is a picture of one:</p>

                </div>

                <div class = "panel-body">

                    <p>Let's get the nitty gritty out of the way.</p>
                    <p> I do not claim to be a professional artist, or even good. My art is done mostly for enjoyment. However, these still take time and effort. As a result, I have picked what I feel to be a fair price of <strong>£5 per sprite.</strong></p>
                    <p>Additionally, I strive for client satisfaction, and will not request payment until we're done and you're happy. Please actually pay me though.</p>
                    <p>I take payment through <strong>PayPal only</strong>, at an address I'll give you when we're ready. (I'd prefer to keep my email off the web away from the bots).</p>

                </div>

            </div>

            <div class = "panel">

                <div class = "panel-heading">

                    <h1>What you'll get</h1>

                </div>

                <div class = "panel-body">

                    <p>I will create a sprite of your character in the style similar to those listed, in a simple pose. This includes accessories such as a sword and shield, or a magic staff.</p>
                    <p>While the level of detail/pixel density will not change, I can export this image at any resolution you like.</p>
                    <p>You're free to use this image wherever you like (profiles, websites, leaflets whatever), but please contact me if you wish to use my work commercially. Credit to me does not have to be ever present, but please do not claim my work as your own.</p>
                    <p><strong>Currently, I will not produce any art of a sexual or offensive nature.</strong></p>
                    <p>I can also make low fps gifs of your character, although this depends on what's suitable to be animated (Ear twitches, moving tails, sword shine etc.). I don't make any promises in this area, other than I can make it blink.</p>
                    <p>When I've finished the initial piece, I will present it to you, and we can discuss whatever changes you'd like for you to be satisfied. While I aim to deliver your sprite relatively quickly, please remember I am just a man, with a full time job.</p>

                <div class = "panel-body">

                    <p>In order to draw your character, I need to know what it looks like. I need pictures of them from front, side and possibly back angles, along with any accessories that aren't covered by those. If you have character details that aren't represented in-game, please describe them to me.</p>
                    <p>On completion of the sprite, I usually post the images to my tumblr, and will display it on this site. If you're happy with my service, I may ask for a short quote.</p>
