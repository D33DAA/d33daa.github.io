				<h1>You are listening to... 99% Invisible (19/07/16)</h1>
			
			</div>
			
			<div class = "panel-body">
			
				<p>This post is not about video games. Go take a walk. Are you back? Did you have a good time? Did you catch any pokemon? Now you've calmed down, I'll get to it. Today I'm going to write a little bit about 2 different things I've been listening to this week that have been recent discoveries for me.</p>
				
				<p>The first is <a href = "http://youarelistening.to/losangeles">You are listening to...</a></p>
				
				<p>I'm not being mysterious, that's the name and its like that for a reason. It's a web service that combines soundcloud playlists of long ambience tracks with your choice of police scanner radio from different locations.</p>
				
				<img src = "http://www.lataco.com/wp-content/uploads/you_are_listening_to_LA.jpg" alt = "A picture of a city at night, with the text 'You are listening to Los Angeles'">
				
				<p>It allows you to tune in to publicly available broadcasts of police scanner radios (mostly in the US) and coupled with the ambience, the result is unexpectedly relaxing, while intriguing. This has a particular effect for me, because I've always been a fan of the police aesthetic. By that, I mean I love the black, red and blue colours, the flashing lights, the sirens, the technical lingo and the radio. I've also loved the general aspects of radio. I get a kick out of the low bitrate voices, the static and the electronic communication, with the occasional morse code. I don't know if that makes me weird... Will you let me know?</p>
				
				<p>Most of the available police radio streams are US based, as I believe only the US keeps their channels open in this fashion. There are other radio sources available, mostly residing in Europe. They consist of the air traffic control radios of many international airports, the fire and medical services for many areas (also in the US) and some other exceptions, such as a feed of NASA sounds, accompanied by the video stream of the ISS's view of Earth.</p>
				
				<img src = "http://i.imgur.com/TvRKXCq.png" alt = "A world map showing shield, plane and miscellaneous icons, mostly over europe and the USA.">
				
				<p>I just find it nice to stick on while I'm working or doing something peaceful. Maybe I get excited when I hear about crimes happening live. Don't look at me like that.</p>
				
				<h3>I just had a very brief, but very intense craving for a very particular type of sausage...</h3>
				
				<p>Sorry about that. I was trying to think of a good way to seperate these segments  when that happened so I just thought I'd go with it.The other audio thing I would like to talk about is <a href = "http://99percentinvisible.org/">99% Invisible</a>, a podcast about design.</p>
				
				<p>It mostly consists of short episodes, five to ten minutes long about a very wide range of topics. So far this has included episodes on toothbrushes, flags, banks, and more. That doesn't sound very interesting on the surface but that's where the title comes in. The point is that so much of our life is very purposefully designed, and most of it we barely notice. As said in an episode in the show, 'the thing you notice least, probably had the most time spent designing it'.</p>
				
				<img src = "http://cdn.99percentinvisible.org/wp-content/uploads/powerpress/99invisible-logo-1400.jpg" alt = "The 99 percent invisible logo, which consists of the text 99 percent invisible on the background of a black grid with grey line, a single square of which being yellow">
				
				<p>The podcast provides some really interesting insights on design and there are plenty of episodes to catch up with. A standout feature of this podcast is its production style and quality. Rather than just plain speech, the audio switches between diffferent voices, complimented by music and sound effects. Done badly, it could have been unneccesary and distracting, but in this, it works well and makes the listening experience much more profound. The podcast was how I found out about 'You are listening to..' and I in turn found this from a TED talk given by the creator, where he recreates one of his episodes:</p>

				<h1>I Didn't Like Dragon Age: Inquisition (04/07/16)</h1>
			
			</div>
			
			<div class = "panel-body">
			
				<p>There were a lot of sales on over multiple platforms this weekend and I had the itching to try something. I have good friends that have played and recommended Dragon Age and the GOTY edition was half price on Origin (everyone's favourite platform). I had also of course seen numerous beautfiul screenshots around tumblr and the like. I could tell it was a game that could take a while to fully kick off so I spent quite a bit of time (unforutnately over the refund limit) over the weekend but it didn't really catch for me.</p>
				
				<img src = "http://blogs-images.forbes.com/erikkain/files/2014/10/daI-cover.jpg" alt = "The cover picture for Dragon Age: Inquisition">
			
			<p>The first major issue came rather early on. I will admit that this is quite a lot my fault, but you should know that you will spend a lot of time looking at the character you make. The game is played in third person, so you can't even escape outside of cutscenes. Okay, brace yourselves. I fucked up in character creation. Real bad. Look at this:</p>
			
			<img src = "http://i.imgur.com/gCc8hJ7.png" alt = "A very ugly man.">
				
			<p>Give it a long, hard stare. Ignore the burning in your eyes. Experience the suffering as I have. I have to look at this goddamn thing the whole time. It was all downhill from there. I guess I was looking for a similar vibe to Skyrim, a good RPG to just get fully immersed in. However, DA:I plays a lot like a single player World of Warcraft.  I despise of the combat and gameplay of usual MMOs. I don't like just having a hotbar of abilities, holding down the attack button while your character flails their limbs at whatever's near by, while occasionally pushing a button for a heal or an attack that does slightly more damage than usual. It just misses that feeling of control and feedback that I find important for combat to be fun.</p>
				
				<p> I also find that the third person perspective really subtracts from my attempts to get into the game world and feel the consequences of my actions. The MMO nature means that the locations are filled with endless meaningless fetch or kill-everything-in-this-area quests. I find it hard to relate to the characters as they all seem to be exaggerated fantasy archtypes. A brash dwarf and a reserved, snobby elf. How exciting.</p>
				
				<p>Character and equipment progression is also unfortunately MMO style, with endless looting of corpses, spending hours in the inventory screen to see which identical sword has +1 DPS compared to the one you're already using. Leveling up is unfortunately similar. The character screen presents you with numerous trees of stat increases and boring abilties.</p>
				
				<p>Another "selling point" of Inquisition is being able to manage your party and even pause the game to give commands. The problem I had with this was that I just didn't care about any of the other characters and I found that giving orders rarely achieved anything over than wasting my timne. Sure, I get more control over how the battle goes, but I never saw my party performing better than when I just left it to the AI.</p>
				
				<img src = "http://i.imgur.com/5pH8jWe.jpg" alt = "The D33DAA face photoshopped over a picture of the dragon age inquisition player.">
				<p>I spent longer on that than I should have.</p>
				
				<p>As my final begrudging complaint, you see the arm thing he's doing in the first mage. You will be doing that a lot. The whole game is based around closing giant green rifts with your cancerous, radioactive hands. This consists of standing then and pressing a button, hoping nothing attacks you in the process. You do this a lot. Riveting.</p>
				<p>Overall, my experience with Dragon Age: Inquisition was one of dissapointment and failed potential. I realise that many others like it, but for me, there is some much that I can see could be improved on. I should make more D33DAA photoshops.</p>

				<h1>I Left OxenCraft (01/07/16)</h1>
			
			</div>
			
			<div class = "panel-body">
			
				<p>I had been debating this decision for a long time. This server has meant a lot to me and I'm proud to have been a part of it from close to the beginning. I was around for a lot of major events, like the birth of the first town, VillageVillage and the first Capture The Sheep event.  I had a lot of truly amazing and often hilarious times, and made a lot of friends. The community and the staff team remain some of the best people I have ever played with. This isn't really helping you picture why I left so I should probably get around to that. I didn't leave because of any arguments within staff, or the community as a whole and I didn't leave because I didn't like where the server was going.</p>
				
				<img src = "http://i.imgur.com/hej7reo.png" alt = "Oxencraft 2.1 Update Logo">
				
				<p> The answer is, simply, that I am just bored of Minecraft. Minecraft is a timeless game, that I have always and I am sure I always will come back to, but the periods I am interested are limited. I think of myself as a cyclical gamer, for a few months, I'll play a few games. I'll get bored of them and move on to more for a few months. In later cycles, I'll return to the games I like most along with anything new that tickles my fancy. My point is, my interest in a game is never permanent, but just because I've got bored of a game doesn't mean I won't come back to it in the future.</p>
				
				
				<p>For this stint, I had come back to minecraft after a few years, but I admit I disliked some of the changes that had happened before. my biggest hate was megaservers, with slots of thousands.</p>
				
				<img src = "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/6EPTobSXTPQ/maxresdefault.jpg" alt = "A Minecraft server browser, showing servers with slots of up to 9000">
				
				<p>How are you supposed to grow a community and get to know people when there are thousands of people around? I would much rather have a smaller playerbase where everyone knows each other and the players welcome new joiners. That was what attracted Oxencraft to me the most, as I had been server hopping simply looking for servers that would welcome me. I'm also disappointed in the direction adventure maps have gone. In the past, we've seen epics of story telling, with beautifully crafted stories and dialogue. Presently, 80% of maps are just contextless parkour maps, but the designated adventure maps dissapoint me even more. The extra functionality made possible by new blocks and especially command blocks and resource packs ought to mean that adventure maps are even more ambitious. But most I find just turn out to be extended tech demos of half baked ideas. Anyway, I'm on a tangent here.</p>

				<h1>My First HOTAS™ (29/06/16)</h1>

			</div>

			<div class ="panel-body">

				<p>Took a break from Minecraft yesterday due to having a driving lesson in the evening. That and my Thrustmaster HOTAS arrived. I've been playing Elite:Dangerous recently and the jury's verdict is that a HOTAS is the way to go. That and I use my HTC Vive to play, which led to me frantically punching different areas of the keyboard to find the landing gear. I installed the drivers, found a commended binding and then cried over the reference sheet. It's pretty complicated and makes use of multiple 'shift' keys. This is pretty alien to me but I can see that once I get used to it, it will be much easier than the keyboard.</p>

				<img src ="http://images.bit-tech.net/content_images/2012/07/cyborg-fly-5-vs-thrustmaster-t-flight-hotas/tflighthotasx-5-1280x1024.jpg" alt = "A thrustmaster X brand flight stick and throttle setup.">

				<p> I tried the training missions over again to get a feel for how it works. Free aiming is a bitch, but dogfighting and travelling are a lot more fun. UI Focus is something I'll have to get used to, but from what I can see it'll be actually better than before. Additionally, the binding I had annoyingly had no settings for Galaxy Map, which is easily the most frustrating part of playing in VR. I mapped the camera and "blue circle thing" to the joy stick and my world was changed. Gone are the days taking off the headset to type the name of the system in search and fighting the game to select it as a destination. A solitary tear rolled down my cheek. </p>

				<img src ="http://www.pcinvasion.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/elite-dangerous-8.png" alt = "An image of the Elite:Dangerous Galaxy Map, showing a few stars and a menu, with the Milky Way in the background.">

				<p>That was all I had time for in the evening, but I'm definitely looking forward to using it more. I haven't used it enough to recommend the particular brand, but it is pretty cheap (Around £30 GBP for me) for a HOTAS and was ideal just as an entry level kit. I would however, recommend using any HOTAS for Elite, as it makes the experience a lot more reactive and tangible. Kind of like playing on Expert in DJHero.</p>

				<p>Small sidenote, when using the keyboard, your hands in game remain in their idle state, but using a HOTAS will actually match your actions, adding to the feel.</p>

			<h1>An Update: Dammit (28/06/16)</h1>

		</div>

		<div class = "panel-body">

			<p>I tried some things out in creative yesterday and it turns out iron farms do not work in the end. Dammit.</p>

			<p>This isn't too much as a blow as it was just going to be for my benefit and I can always build it in overworld and just teleport in and out.  This also reduces the difficulty I would have had ensuring it was far away enough from the farm. That brings me onto the farm. The farm design uses villagers also and I consider it and the food distribution network a major part of the station.  I will have to do more testing but I can only hope it works.</p>

			<p> In the meantime, here's my favourite GIF (Pronounced with a hard G) of all time:</p>

			<h1>Night Vale Station (27/06/16)</h1>

		</div>

		<div class = "panel-body">

            <p>My latest project is a space station in the End. I think it's quite an interesting idea for a village. Naturally, it has high requirements to entry, as you must make your own way to the end before you are allowed to teleport in and out of it. Additionally, I am adding a rule that space helmets (blocks of glass renamed) must be worn with /hat, which is only available to some player ranks. Additionally, you cannot claim land in the End, so I must be able to trust everyone of my residents.</p>

			<p>This is mostly inspired by my recent playtime in Elite Dangerous and while I find MC lacking for spacey stuff, I am going to do it anyway. It's also inspired by the Welcome to night Vale Podcast that I've been listening to recently. I hope to incorporate the bizarre humour throught the station while keeping it as advanced and useful as possible. Here's a plan I made in MS Paint for the start of the station:</p>

			<img src ="http://i.imgur.com/BsBxq7L.png">

			<p>I'm hoping to include a metro system and a food distribution system. The metro will run under the station by minecart and have junctions, using a system I've designed before. I will also have a fully automatic potato farm that will then be distributed to different parts of the station by minecart running over the station. I'll be using this design: </p>

			<div class="embed-responsive embed-responsive-16by9">

  				<iframe class="embed-responsive-item" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/VB1n_2bLk4o"></iframe>

			</div>

			<p>The products of this farm will be distributed by the system. The iron farm is top priority for me as the materials I will be using, quartz, and black clay are not cheap. I will also have to make sure the iron farm and food farm are more than 64 blocks apart to prevent issues. I am yet to know if villager ai works in the End, but I will be doing tests.</p>

			<p>In order to restrict access to locations without claims, I have found a helpful tutorial on a passcard system that looks very interesting: </p>

			</div>

			<p>Just a side note, this is the design I have for the station banner. It's based off the Night Vale logo. Hope you like it!</p>
