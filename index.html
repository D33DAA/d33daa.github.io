			<h1>My First HOTAS™ (29/06/16)</h1>
			<p>Took a break from Minecraft yesterday due to having a driving lesson in the evening. That and my Thrustmaster HOTAS arrived. I've been playing Elite:Dangerous recently and the jury's verdict is that a HOTAS is the way to go. That and I use my HTC Vive to play, which lead to me frantically punching different areas of the keyboard to find the landing gear. I installed the drivers, found a commended binding and then cried over the reference sheet. It's pretty complicated and makes use of multiple 'shift' keys. This is pretty alien to me but I can see that once I get used to it, it will be much easier than the keyboard.</p>

			<p> I tried the training missions over again to get a feel for how it works. Free aiming is a bitch, but dogfighting and travelling are a lot more fun. UI Focus is something I'll have to get used to, but from what I can see it'll be actually better than before. Additionally, the binding I had annoyingly had no settings for Galaxy Map, which is easily the most frustrating part of playing in VR. I mapped the camera and "blue circle thing" to the joy stick and my world was changed. Gone are the days taking off the headset to type the name of the system in search and fighting the game to select it as a destination. A solitary tear rolled down my cheek. </p>

			<p>That was all I had time for in the evening, but I'm definitely looking forward to using it more. I haven't used it enough to recommend the particular brand, but it is pretty cheap (Around £30 GBP for me) for a HOTAS and was ideal just as an entry level kit. I would however, recommend using any HOTAS for Elite, as it makes the experience a lot more reactive and tangible. Kind of like playing on Expert in DJHero.</p>

			<p>Small sidenote, when using the keyboard, your hands in game remain in their idle state, but using a HOTAS will actually match your actions, adding to the feel.</p>

			<h1>An Update: Dammit (28/06/16)</h1>
			<p>I tried some things out in creative yesterday and it turns out iron farms do not work in the end. Dammit.</p>
			<p>This isn't too much as a blow as it was just going to be for my benefit and I can always build it in overworld and just teleport in and out.  This also reduces the difficulty I would have had ensuring it was far away enough from the farm. That brings me onto the farm. The farm design uses villagers also and I consider it and the food distribution network a major part of the station.  I will have to do more testing but I can only hope it works.</p>
			<p> In the meantime, here's my favourite GIF (Pronounced with a hard G) of all time:</p>

            <h1>Night Vale Station (27/06/16)</h1>
            <p>My latest project is a space station in the End. I think it's quite an interesting idea for a village. Naturally, it has high requirements to entry, as you must make your own way to the end before you are allowed to teleport in and out of it. Additionally, I am adding a rule that space helmets (blocks of glass renamed) must be worn with /hat, which is only available to some player ranks. Additionally, you cannot claim land in the End, so I must be able to trust everyone of my residents.</p>
			<p>This is mostly inspired by my recent playtime in Elite Dangerous and while I find MC lacking for spacey stuff, I am going to do it anyway. It's also inspired by the Welcome to night Vale Podcast that I've been listening to recently. I hope to incorporate the bizarre humour throught the station while keeping it as advanced and useful as possible. Here's a plan I made in MS Paint for the start of the station:</p>
			<img src ="http://i.imgur.com/BsBxq7L.png">
			<p>I'm hoping to include a metro system and a food distribution system. The metro will run under the station by minecart and have junctions, using a system I've designed before. I will also have a fully automatic potato farm that will then be distributed to different parts of the station by minecart running over the station. I'll be using this design: </p>
			<iframe width="500" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/VB1n_2bLk4o" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>
			<p>The products of this farm will be distributed by the system. The iron farm is top priority for me as the materials I will be using, quartz, and black clay are not cheap. I will also have to make sure the iron farm and food farm are more than 64 blocks apart to prevent issues. I am yet to know if villager ai works in the End, but I will be doing tests.</p>
			<p>In order to restrict access to locations without claims, I have found a helpful tutorial on a passcard system that looks very interesting: </p>

			<p>Just a side note, this is the design I have for the station banner. It's based off the Night Vale logo. Hope you like it!</p>

			<p>I'll update further as time goes on.</p>
