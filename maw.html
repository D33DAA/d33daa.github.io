                            <p>I urge the UAC to make an investigation into the decisions that were made that caused the planned attack on civilians, and to bring justice to those who could have been harmed in the attack.

We attempted to resolve the matter legally and but Delta Corps could not be reasoned with. We are more than happy to peacefully coexist; but further attacks on our economy, or otherwise, will be met with retribution."</p>

With little contest from local forces, and no claims from other factions, the expansion of the Federation's borders are likely an inevitability, and will begin to meet the borders of Lotus Syndicate and The Maw territories.

                            <p>The planet of Teus (Actoylm, 0403) was rudely awoken in the early hours this morning to the sound of UAC strike craft entering the atmosphere in an attempt to destroy the local offices of Delta Corporation, and harm their civilian workers. Rumours speculate the UAC targeted the lives of Delta Corporation employees in response to Delta's increasing market share in their local economy. Miraculously, the builidngs and people remained unscathed (not counting the legal damage done by UAC Lawyers mere days before the incident) due to what witnesses speculate to be a large scale weapons malfunction on the UAC fleet. The CEO of Delta Corporation released this statement after the attack: </p>
                            <p> "We are horrified to see DeltaCorp employees attacked and detained by UAC military personal. This is tyrannical behaviour that we are surprised to see by a previously peaceful collective." </p>

The military manufacturer has established a monopoly for arms sales on the planet, having driven out other competition through superior sales figures and prices. This continues the pattern of Delta Corporation's expansion and economic growth through the sector.</p>

                            <p>ArcNet probes and passing grey-law ships are reporting that a recent discovery of large cobalt deposits in the asteroid belt  of the Romny system (0604) have lead to a major increase in the amount of mining operations in the area. The system, home to infamous pirate organization The Maw, has a major illegal spaceport, through which most of these mining operations have been setup. Increased numbers of unlicensed miners have been reported in the nearby area, and new industries are being hastily organised. This new rush may be a break in the recent shortages of Cobalt in the sector, however, ArcNet feels responsible to warn against trade with The Maw, due to their illicit activities.</p>

                            <p>New constructions point to Delta Corporation aiming to expand its production, by procuring more raw materials. The biggest arms manufacturer and specialist military contractor in the sector, have constructed a mining facility on its base planet of Ledro (Maz 0104), and on the outskirts of the largest city in Mahni, (Raghnil, 0306), the capital world of the Arcadian Federation. A spokesperson for Delta Corporation had this to say: "Our current expansion will reduce the current inefficiencies surrounding sourcing and producing the rare and expensive resources we need to make our products the best possible value for our customers." Economic reports also show that Delta Corporation is making significant investments into the local economy of Teus (Actolym 0403), the capital world of the Unified Arcadian Collective.</p>

                            <p>Staff and Engineers have been noticing an increase in the amount of Arcadian Federation ships and personnel. While the space yards of Anas, the biggest industrial and military spaceyard in Federation controlled space are usually home to the system's standing navy, the public are noticing a large amount of combat vessels leaving the yard, and an increased amount of troop carriers in the area. Aside from patrols hunting the usual pirate threats in the sector, the Arcadian Federation is not known to be in any open conflicts at the time of writing, leaving much to speculation. Standard military routine? Training exercises? Or are the Federation preparing to make the first strike in a new intersector conflict? More details as they are received.</p>
