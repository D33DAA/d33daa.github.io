                            <p>The planet of Teus (Actoylm, 0403) was rudely awoken in the early hours this morning to the sound of UAC strike craft entering the atmosphere in an attempt to destroy the local offices of Delta Corporation, and harm their civilian workers. Rumours speculate the UAC targeted the lives of Delta Corporation employees in response to Delta's increasing market share in their local economy. Miraculously, the builidngs and people remained unscathed (not counting the legal damage done by UAC Lawyers mere days before the incident) due to what witnesses speculate to be a large scale weapons malfunction on the UAC fleet. The CEO of Delta Corporation released this statement after the attack: </p>
                            <p> "We are horrified to see DeltaCorp employees attacked and detained by UAC military personal. This is tyrannical behaviour that we are surprised to see by a previously peaceful collective." </p>

                            <p>ArcNet probes and passing grey-law ships are reporting that a recent discovery of large cobalt deposits in the asteroid belt  of the Romny system (0604) have lead to a major increase in the amount of mining operations in the area. The system, home to infamous pirate organization The Maw, has a major illegal spaceport, through which most of these mining operations have been setup. Increased numbers of unlicensed miners have been reported in the nearby area, and new industries are being hastily organised. This new rush may be a break in the recent shortages of Cobalt in the sector, however, ArcNet feels responsible to warn against trade with The Maw, due to their illicit activities.</p>

                            <p>Dear Prime Minister of the Arcadian Federation,</p>
                            <p>I am glad to hear that you are in agreement about our visions of the future. I agree to the terms of informing you of any future development in the Arcadian Federation's space.</p>
                            <p>Our current plans in UAC's space involve investments in their economy to the detriment of the UAC. DeltaCorp alone, however, does not have enough assets to complete this alone and I feel that, together, we can achieve a lot more. Our future plans in the UAC will likely involve some more covert action.</p>
                            <p>Additionally, we would like to discuss some further plans on the management of captured psychics; our latest technologies can, more safely than any previous systems, imprison psychics. We believe that we can provide the imprisonment as a service to the Arcadian Federation.</p>
                            <p>Regards,</p>
                            <p>Havina Sperlov</p>

                            <p>I feel it is important for DeltaCorp to reach out to the Arcadian Federation to discuss our long term goals regarding our investments and work within the UAC.</p>
                            <p>I believe DeltaCorp's vision is aligned with the Arcadian Federation's, especially in regards for the future of psychics and the impact that these have on our worlds.</p>

                            <p>Greetings Commander. Delta Corporation has acquired a mining facility on our capital world Mahni, (Raghnil, 0306). The Harvester has the potential to generate additional income for the Corporation. its operations or presence will not affect our economy and poses no risk to us. It should also be noted that they are making financial investments into the independant economics of Teus (Actolym 0403), the capital world of the UAC. These investments have the potential to increase purchasing costs for the UAC on that world.</p>
                            <p>Have a good day.</p>

                            <p>New constructions point to Delta Corporation aiming to expand its production, by procuring more raw materials. The biggest arms manufacturer and specialist military contractor in the sector, have constructed a mining facility on its base planet of Ledro (Maz 0104), and on the outskirts of the largest city in Mahni, (Raghnil, 0306), the capital world of the Arcadian Federation. A spokesperson for Delta Corporation had this to say: "Our current expansion will reduce the current inefficiencies surrounding sourcing and producing the rare and expensive resources we need to make our products the best possible value for our customers." Economic reports also show that Delta Corporation is making significant investments into the local economy of Teus (Actolym 0403), the capital world of the Unified Arcadian Collective.</p>

                            <p>Staff and Engineers have been noticing an increase in the amount of Arcadian Federation ships and personnel. While the space yards of Anas, the biggest industrial and military spaceyard in Federation controlled space are usually home to the system's standing navy, the public are noticing a large amount of combat vessels leaving the yard, and an increased amount of troop carriers in the area. Aside from patrols hunting the usual pirate threats in the sector, the Arcadian Federation is not known to be in any open conflicts at the time of writing, leaving much to speculation. Standard military routine? Training exercises? Or are the Federation preparing to make the first strike in a new intersector conflict? More details as they are received.</p>
